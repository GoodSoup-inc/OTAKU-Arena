# OTAKU Arena

Created by Tyron O. and Taylor M.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, OTAKU Arena, is for anime lover of all kind. It allows users to decide who is the strongest in all of the anime universe. This application would put an end to the question 'Who would win' in a fun and exciting way

## API & React Router

This application will use the Jikan API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]

**Example:**

- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin` and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

- On the `/example` page, users can...
- On the `/example` page, users can...

- On the `/artworks/:artworkId` page, users can view additional details for a single piece of art
